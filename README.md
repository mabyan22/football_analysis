This repository was created to display some of the scatter plots I created comparing footballers' statistics from Europe's Top 5 Leagues in the ongoing season.
The data was used from fbref.com, and includes, from each league, each player's statistics for the entire 2021-22 season. I have specifically used expected goals and expected assists for the graphs. 
Expected goals (xG) and expected assists (xA) are calculated using something resembling a machine learning algorithm. Data for thousands of previous shots taken, and their outcomes, is stored. This is then used to calculate the probability of a shot, taken by a player, resulting in a goal using information about the shot such as distance from goal, angle to goal, body part used to take the shot (headers are common in football). xG is measured on a scale of zero to one, with 0 xG meaning that it is impossible to score from that shot and 1 xG meaning that the player would be expected to score from that shot every single time. If a certain shot is given an xG value of 0.1, this means that an average player would be expected to score one goal from every ten shots in this situation or 10% of the time.
The plots include under 25 players only, and the top performing players' names are highlighted.
